This directory contains interfaces and implementations that isolate the
rest of the package from platform details.

Code in the rest of the package includes "port.h" from this directory.
"port.h" in turn includes a platform specific "port_<platform>.h" file
that provides the platform specific implementation.

See port_posix.h for an example of what must be provided in a platform
specific header file.

可以看到大部分开源项目，平台相关的代码都会放到一个叫port的目录下，port有移植的含义~
